# Minimum interval in milliseconds for measurements per measurement type per tag.

# Limiting strategy, currently valid values: "default" and "defaultWithMotionSensitivity".
# The default in both is to discard packets and only to save a packet every [measurementUpdateLimit] milliseconds
# (see above). Additionally, the "defaultWithMotionSensitivity" strategy saves packets that exhibit sudden acceleration
# changes. The exact threshold is configurable using the limitingStrategy.defaultWithMotionSensitivity.threshold
# property.

# Note, the value below has no effect if "default" has been set as the limiting strategy above.

# Storage method, currently valid values: "influxdb", "legacy_influxdb" and "dummy"
# influxdb        = Recommended and default, this stores the values to InfluxDB into a single measurement
# influxdb_legacy = The old format used by this collector on versions before 0.2.0, stores values into separate measurements.
#                   NOTE: influxdb_legacy is no longer supported, you should use the new influxdb format and migrate old data, see CHANGELOG.md

# extended  = In addition to the above, calculate additional values such as absolute humidity, dew point, total acceleration and air density.
#             Ignores the storage.values.list property. NOTE: the influxdb_legacy storage method does not support extended values
# whitelist = Only the values given in the storage.values.list property are stored. (influxdb_legacy storage method not supported.)

# Note that leaving this list empty while setting storage.values=whitelist results in an exception: no sensor data

# in a warning, as that is essentially just the same as setting storage.values=extended -- nothing is banned.
